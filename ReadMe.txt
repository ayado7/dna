Project Description:
Did Not Ask is an anonymous sharing platform for you to share stories that happened to you or you've been through such as abuse, marginalization, mistreatment, forced displacement, or unfairness as examples, and extends to any situation which you "Did not ask for". The problem is that it's often hard to share these stories with the public, or even our close friends, at the same time, many of us are unaware of what others are going through in their daily lives. This platform gives you space to share such stories safely, raise awareness about such topics, and have an insight into what other people are going through so you know you're not alone, and you have more sympathy towards other people in your life.
